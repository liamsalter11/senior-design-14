Visible Light Communication


Project Description: 

Students  will design  a digital communication system that represents data by flashing a 
light source, and which can operate in an environment that includes ambient lighting. 


Project Specifications: 

The system will include a transmitter that represents binary or multi-level data symbols 
by varying the amplitude, phase, or frequency of the flashing light, and a receiver that 
can decode the transmitted data by sensing the variations in light intensity. 

The system must be able to operate in a room that includes ambient lighting. 

The  receiver  must  optimal,  in  the  sense  that  the  received  signal  is  processed 
according to an algorithm that minimizes the bit error rate when the received signal is 
observed in additive white Gaussian noise. 

There will be an option in the transmitter to include a simple error-correction coding 
scheme, and in the receiver to decode the bits and correct some errors, so that the bit 
error rare is reduced. 

The  system  must  be  able  to  achieve  a  bit  error  rate  of  less  than  0.01  over  short 
distances without error-correction coding. 

The  team  must  test  the  system  over  a  range  of  distances  between  transmitter  and 
receiver. Statistical measures must be calculated that quantify the bit error rate as a 
function of distance. 

The team must test the system with and without error-correction coding, and quantify 
the improvement in bit error rate that results from the coding scheme.
